## About Aldrumo

Born out of a failed side-project, Aldrumo is one of the first TALL stack Content Management Systems. Built upon the latest technologies, Aldrumo's mission is to provide a great experience for both the developer and the end user.

Built upon a standard Laravel and Livewire installation, Aldrumo lives as tested packages meaning you still get the full power of Laravel, with no compromise. This, along with growing extensive documentation makes for a great developer experience when building your site.

With an amazing WYSIWYG editor and the SPA feel thanks to Livewire, Aldrumo also aims to give the end user a fantastic and easy to use way to manage their website!
